# NeRF ModelðŸ¤–

### Overview

NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) is a project aimed at generating highly detailed 3D scenes from 2D images using neural networks. 
By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of 2D images taken from various angles, the model can predict 
the color and density at any point in 3D space. This project is particularly useful in fields like computer graphics, 
augmented reality, and virtual reality, where realistic 3D scene reconstruction is critical.
